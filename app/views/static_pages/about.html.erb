  <h2>About Me</h2>
  Hey, I am Rajeev Reddy, a Third Year Undergraduate student of Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Kharagpur. First of all right of the bat for a chemical engineering student I can say that I am good at programming. I love web based programming most and have been working with it. I am good at the back end part of the web programming but still far behind designing the front end part. Apart from Website building I have major interest in other programming languages like C, Ruby on Rails, C#, C++ and Algorithms Design and Analysis. I have participated in various coding competitions like Yahoo Hack U 2012 and 2013, Microsoft Appathon 2012 both held at IIT Kharagpur.
